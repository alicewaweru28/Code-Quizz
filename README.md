About the Project
This project was built to create a timed coding quiz to test the user's knowledge of Javascript.
The motiviation for this project was to utilize Javascript skills to create an interactive quiz that is timed and allows the user to enter their high score at the end of the game.
Once the user press starts, the games begin.
When the alert is closed, the timer begins and the first question is displayed for the user.
If zero questions are answered correctly, or the time runs out, the user loses and no high scores are recorded.
The final score is the amount of time left on the clock when the quiz is finished.
The amount of correct questions answered will be displayed at the end before a high score can be entered.
The high scores are logged and sorted highest to lowest, the user can clear the high score list at anytime.
Comments have been added to all files to clarify each step and make future updates easier.
